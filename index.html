    <h4>Technology over the Years</h4>
    <header>Technology has evoloved so much over time. Let's backtrack and see where the current technology came from.</header>

  <div class="telephone">
    <p><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-the-telephone-alexander-graham-bell-1991380">The first telephone</a> The first telephone was the stepping stone to many other forms of technology. The first telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell. The telephone was based off of the idea of the telegraph, however the telegraph could only receive and
      send one message at a time. The telephone was a device that allowed speech to be carried over electric currents. Bell and his partner created a transmitter and a membrane with the ability to carry speech over the wires. On June 2, 1875 the
      first telephone call was made, and it was a complete accident. This was a ground breaking milestone because now people could communicate at any time they wanted to from anywhere. This led to a telephone network all over the country. Telephone
      lines were being built and the demand for electronic communication quickly became a staple in everyday lives. The discovery of the telephone allowed people to invent other innovative forms of technology, and showed that their idea could soon
      become a reality.</p>

  <div class="mobile">
    <h1>Mobile technology revolutionized the way we live our daily lives. How did it come to be?</h1>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://bebusinessed.com/history/history-cell-phones/">The first cell phone</a>The first cell phone was invented in 1983. The phone was by Motorola and was named the DynaTAC 800x. The phone was a large and bulky device, but it was still the first portable phone. This mobile phone allowed people to walk around and call
      somebody without being connected to a wire. This wireless invention was a total breakthrough. People could now have conversations with anyone over the phone wherever they were. The telephone played a huge role in the development of the cell
      phone. Essentially the cell phone is just a telephone without a wire. Today, cell phones are pretty much a basic necessity. Technology develops pretty quickly as soon as another device or program comes out. As we can see through the cell phone,
      other companies tried to make their own versions of the cell phone. This allowed the evolution of the cell phone to be the pocket-friendly and more efficient. Without this technology, our lives today would be very different. </p>

  <div class="laptop">
    <h1>Yeah desktops are cool, but LAPTOPS???</h1>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.mln.com.au/info_page/?idlaptophistory">The first laptop</a> The first laptop came out in 1981. The first laptop was called the Osborne 1. This laptop weighed 24.5 pounds and had a very small 5-inch screen. The shape of the device was wide and very awkward. The laptop had 2 floppy drives and a battery
      pack. This technology allowed other tech companies to build off of the system they had to make them more efficient and practical.The Osborne 1 was a huge accomplishment that led to the invention of the cell phone. Both of these devices are
      still used every day all over the world by millions of people. Technology has flourished in such a quick and genius fashion. Laptops have also turned into some people’s workspace. Companies have chosen to run programs on computers and laptops
      for their employees to work off of. Laptops truly revolutionized the way businesses are run and how people find different types of information they need.</p>

  <div class="microsoft">
    <h1>Microsoft, what would we do without it?</h1>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/eight-milestones-in-the-development-of-computers-and-home-technology.html">Microsoft</a> Microsoft was invented by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. Microsoft is really like a network of programs that allows people to create data tables, documents, and many other formatting elements. Microsoft is used all over the world by
      millions of people. Microsoft has really become the standard platform for students to write their papers, essays, or to organize data. Microsoft has many different features and programs. As Microsoft started to grow, they started to add
      more software and they have even come out with many devices, Microsoft came out with the Xbox and they fairly recently launched their tablet, the Microsoft Surface. Microsoft changed the way people work and develop different data or to
      document different ideas. The world would be different today without Microsoft, because without Microsoft I wouldn’t be writing this right now! </p>

  <div class="smart">
    <h1>My house is smarter than me. Who could have saw this coming?</h1>
    <br>
    <p><a href= "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/eight-milestones-in-the-development-of-computers-and-home-technology.html">Smart Homes</a> Smart homes are a new tech accomplishment that many people are searching for today. Technology has developed so rapidly. Tech workers decided to combine technology into their homes by letting technology control their homes features.
      Smart homes are basically controlled by computers or people’s phones. People can touch a button on their phone and that operation would be fufilled by the technology in their home. People could turn the lights off, close the garage, or
      sometimes even lock their door in a touch of a button while they were not at home. This is a huge breakthrough and will probably become one of the standards of living in the near future.</p>
